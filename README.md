## Description

Food4Thought is an innovative web application designed to help you discover restaurants that match your preferences. Users can connect with one another to explore reviews and find dining options nearby.

- Our motivation to make this web application was because of a common interest in food and wanted to implement an API from an established website.
- We built this project to learn how to use the python stack and to learn its capabilties.

## Installation

- Install PSQL from your terminal
- Install Django using the [pipenv install django] command
- Create a database in psql using the [createdb restaurant_reviews_db]
- Use the necessary command in python to navagate through the app, ex: python manage.py runserver, etc.
- Install the psycopg2-binary package from python: [pipenv install psycopg2-binary]
